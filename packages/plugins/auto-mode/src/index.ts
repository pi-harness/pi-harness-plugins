// Option-borne execution: the argv itself names the program, as in `git grep -O./payload.sh` or `git diff --output=victim`. git's parse-options accepts stacked short options (-iO<prog>) and any unambiguous long-option prefix (--open-files-in-pag=<prog>), so a denylist of canonical spellings can always be respelled around; options are therefore allowlisted by exact spelling. An allowlisted spelling is not safe on its own either, because git resolves an exact match first only when the spelling is a registered option of the subcommand in use and otherwise resolves it as a prefix of some other option - `--text` (no such option under cat-file) reaches `--textconv`. Every long option is therefore also rejected when it is a prefix of a programRunningGitOptions entry, whichever allowlist it appears on.
// Repository-borne execution: the argv names nothing at all and the repository's own configuration supplies the program. `diff.<driver>.textconv` plus a `.gitattributes` entry makes plain `git show HEAD`, `git diff`, `git log -p` and `git blame file` execute it, and `filter.<driver>.clean` makes plain `git status` and `git ls-files --modified` execute it. No argv screening can see this, so before every unconfirmed git command the effective configuration is probed for program-executing keys and the command is treated as risky when any are set.

// Configuration keys whose value is a program git may execute, limited to the ones an allowlisted read-only subcommand was measured to reach on git 2.50.1. core.fsmonitor covers status, diff and ls-files; diff.external, diff.<driver>.command and diff.<driver>.textconv cover blame, diff, log, show, grep and cat-file; filter.<driver>.clean, .smudge and .process cover status, diff, ls-files and grep; gpg.program and gpg.<format>.program cover log and show, because a %G placeholder in --format or --pretty forces signature verification of a commit whose object carries a gpgsig header and that spawns the configured gpg program; core.hooksPath covers status, which refreshes and rewrites the index and so runs <hooksPath>/post-index-change.
// core.sshCommand, sequence.editor and uploadpack.packObjectsHook were removed from this list after a payload planted in each of them was not executed by any of blame, cat-file, describe, diff, grep, log, ls-files, ls-tree, rev-parse, show or status. The same sweep found nothing executed through core.editor, core.pager, pager.<cmd>, core.askPass, core.gitProxy, core.alternateRefsCommand, credential.helper, diff.guitool, difftool.<tool>.cmd, merge.<driver>.driver, mergetool.<tool>.cmd, trailer.<token>.command, remote.<name>.uploadpack or ssh.variant either.
// core.hooksPath was tried the same way and kept, because a hook directory holding an executable post-index-change did run it from `git status` and `git status --short`. It is the one key that does not make every subcommand risky: with all 28 hook names githooks(5) documents planted in the directory as executables, the only ones that ran were post-index-change from those two invocations, and nothing at all ran from blame, cat-file, describe, diff, diff HEAD, grep, log, log -p, ls-files, ls-files --modified, ls-tree, rev-parse or show. It is therefore treated as risky only for the subcommands that read the worktree or refresh the index, which keeps `git log`, `git show` and `git rev-parse` working in the husky repositories that set it - a guard that blocks every command in a repository laid out the way most JavaScript repositories are laid out gets switched off, and then nothing is guarded. The set is deliberately wider than the measurement: blame, grep, diff and ls-files rewrite the index for the same stat-refresh reason status does, so they keep asking even though a hook was only observed to run from status, and from diff on some runs but not others.
// Screening this key is not by itself a guard against the hook route, and reading it as one would be a mistake: core.hooksPath moves a directory git uses in either case, so an executable .git/hooks/post-index-change reaches the same program execution in a repository whose configuration is empty. runsIndexChangeHook is what covers that, for the same subcommand set and by resolving the effective directory rather than the key.
// Only the repository's own scopes count. --show-scope labels every entry, and system, global and command scope describe the machine the agent is running on - the user's ~/.gitconfig, /etc/gitconfig, and this probe's own -c arguments - rather than the untrusted repository this probe exists for, so a machine-wide git-lfs filter no longer makes every command in every clean repository risky. Every other scope, including local, worktree and any scope name this code does not recognise, is treated as repository-controlled. `include.path` and `includeIf` inside .git/config are reported as local scope, so an include cannot launder a hostile key into global scope.
// `git help config` also documents core.pager and pager.<cmd>, credential.helper, core.editor, merge.<driver>.driver, mergetool.<tool>.cmd, difftool.<tool>.cmd and diff.guitool as program-executing. The pager keys have a second reason to be excluded: git only starts a pager when stdout is a terminal and auto mode always runs commands through execFile with a pipe - a core.pager pointing at a script runs under `script -q /dev/null git log` and does not run under execFile - and the top-level -p and --paginate spellings that would force one are rejected before this point as unknown subcommands. The measurement behind all of these is one payload per key and 19 invocations covering every allowlisted subcommand; a route that needs a repository state the sweep did not create would not have shown up in it. alias.* is excluded because git never resolves an alias whose name is a built-in command, and every allowlisted subcommand is built in.

Walking every submodule's configuration is its own bug surface, so the presence of any submodule instead makes every unconfirmed git command risky; a submodule in an agent workspace is rare enough that the confirmation costs little.
// The signal is a gitlink - index mode 160000 - because that entry is what makes git descend into the directory. The other candidate signals are both evadable: a `.gitmodules` file is gone once it is deleted from the worktree, and `.git/modules` does not exist when the submodule is an embedded repository staged with a plain `git add`, yet `git status` was measured to run the payload in both of those layouts. --abbrev=4 shortens the object name that is never read, and -z makes the record boundary a NUL so that a path containing a newline cannot forge one.
// The `:/` pathspec is load-bearing: `git ls-files` lists only the part of the index under the current directory, while `git status` and `git diff` cover the whole repository from anywhere inside it, so without a top-level pathspec a submodule beside the agent's working directory - workspace/src as the working directory, workspace/sub as the submodule - was measured to leave the index probe seeing no gitlink at all while `git status` still ran the submodule's filter.
