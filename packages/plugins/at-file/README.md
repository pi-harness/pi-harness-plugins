# @pi-harness/plugin-at-file

@file Context — Attach a bounded 256 KiB strict UTF-8 workspace file using canonical workspace path confinement and no-follow regular-file reads, framing it as offline, read-only, untrusted model context with closing-tag neutralization and cancellable sequential execution.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-exact @pi-harness/plugin-at-file
```

## Enable

Add the entry to the Cordis profile the harness starts from:

```yaml
- id: at-file
  name: "@pi-harness/plugin-at-file"
  config: {}
```

The Pi Harness plugin marketplace installs and enables this package for you; the steps above are the manual equivalent.

## Workspace ownership

Attachments resolve against the active native session workspace. Session replacement, a native session ID change or a workspace change clears the previous attachment panel and rejects reads that were started in the old scope. Before the native runtime is available, the launch workspace is used. Bounded file reads observe caller/lifecycle cancellation between their open, metadata and 64 KiB chunk boundaries; an individual filesystem operation already in flight must settle first. On scope replacement, obsolete content is discarded before it can be returned to the model.
